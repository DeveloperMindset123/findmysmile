The overbite dental procedure involves addressing an increased vertical overlap of the maxillary and mandibular incisors, which can lead to traumatic effects on the gingival tissues. This condition may result from various factors such as skeletal, dental, and growth rotational elements. The consequences of a traumatic deep bite include severe shearing of gingival tissues, food impaction, gingival recession, dentin hypersensitivity, loss of attachment, and tooth mobility. Treatment typically involves a thorough and systematic approach to periodontal and occlusal examination, diagnosis, and treatment planning to achieve better outcomes. In some cases, prevention of the condition is emphasized over treatment due to the challenging nature of the problem.
