The crossbite dental procedure described in the provided data involves the use of different techniques for correction. In Case 2, tongue blade therapy was employed where the patient was instructed to use a tongue blade as a fulcrum to rotate the oral part up and forwards for 1-2 hours daily for 2-3 weeks. This method successfully corrected the crossbite. In Case 3, Hawley’s with z spring appliance was utilized to correct the crossbite. The Z spring was activated by opening the coils with universal pliers until the tip of the active arm was deflected by 2 millimeters, exerting a force of 25-30g for 2-3 weeks. In Case 4, a combination of Hawley’s with z spring appliance and 2/4 appliance was used for crossbite correction and alignment. The Z spring was activated similarly, and the 2/4 appliance utilized Niti wires' elastic property for tooth alignment in the arch. Regular monitoring of oral hygiene and follow-up appointments were emphasized for maintaining proper bite alignment and ensuring successful outcomes with minimal discomfort to the patients.
