The crossbite dental procedures described in the provided data involve using different techniques for correction. In Case 2, tongue blade therapy was employed where the patient was instructed to rotate the oral part up and forwards using a tongue blade as a fulcrum. This method was used for 1-2 hours daily for 2-3 weeks, resulting in complete correction of the crossbite. In Case 3, Hawley’s with z spring appliance was utilized to correct the crossbite. The Z spring was activated by opening the coils until the tip of the active arm was deflected by 2 millimeters, exerting a force lasting for two to three weeks. In Case 4, a combination of Hawley’s with z spring appliance and 2/4 appliance was used for crossbite correction and alignment of the teeth in the arch. These procedures led to successful outcomes without significant complications, emphasizing the importance of regular monitoring and follow-up appointments for maintaining proper bite alignment.
