The open bite dental procedure can vary depending on the severity of the malocclusion. Simple open bites that occur during the transition from primary to permanent dentition often resolve without treatment. However, complex open bites that extend further back or do not resolve by the end of the mixed dentition years may require orthodontic and/or surgical intervention. Treatment options range from observation and habit control to more complex surgical procedures. Successful identification of the underlying causes of the open bite is crucial for determining the most effective treatment approach. Long-term clinical outcomes are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment, and early initiation of treatment may be beneficial in some cases.
