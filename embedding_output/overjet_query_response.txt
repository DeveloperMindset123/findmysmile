The data provided suggests that there is a discussion on the timing of treatment for children with a large overjet. While early treatment may not be necessary for all cases, it is indicated that there could be potential differences in outcomes between early and later treatment. It is mentioned that an increased overjet can have negative impacts on oral health-related quality of life and may make a child more susceptible to bullying. The recommendation is to consider early treatment, especially if there is a perceived higher risk of dental trauma or if the child is facing teasing due to the overjet. The decision on when to start treatment should be based on clinical judgment and the best available evidence, with careful case selection advised for early intervention to reduce the risk of trauma.
