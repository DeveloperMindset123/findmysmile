Cross Bite Correction Procedure: Cross bite correction is a dental procedure aimed at improving the alignment of teeth for individuals with a cross bite condition. The process typically involves several stages, starting with an initial assessment to determine the best treatment plan. Orthodontic treatments like braces may be used to gradually shift the teeth into proper alignment. In some cases, surgery might be necessary to correct the alignment of the jaws. The procedure can enhance the individual's smile, improve chewing efficiency, and prevent issues like uneven wear on the teeth and jaw pain. The success of the procedure depends on factors such as the severity of the cross bite and adherence to the treatment plan. Costs for cross bite correction can vary based on the specific treatment required and individual case.

All-On-Six Implant Procedure: The All-On-Six implant procedure is a dental treatment known for its high success rate, with studies showing success rates exceeding 95% in the long term. This procedure involves the placement of six dental implants to support a full arch of teeth, providing a stable and natural-looking solution for individuals with missing teeth. The process typically begins with a comprehensive assessment to determine the suitability for the procedure. The implants are strategically placed in the jawbone to ensure optimal support for the prosthetic teeth. Following the procedure, proper care and maintenance of the dental implants are crucial for long-term success. Costs for the All-On-Six implant procedure can vary depending on factors such as the materials used, the complexity of the case, and additional treatments required.

Bad Breath Treatment: Bad breath, also known as halitosis, is a common issue that can have a significant impact on an individual's social and psychological well-being. Treatment for bad breath typically involves identifying the underlying causes, which can be either pathological or physiological. Pathological halitosis, which accounts for the majority of cases, often originates from the mouth due to factors like poor oral hygiene or dental issues. Physiological halitosis, on the other hand, can stem from systemic conditions or other areas outside the mouth. Treatment may include improving oral hygiene practices, addressing dental problems, and managing any underlying health issues contributing to bad breath. Costs for bad breath treatment can vary depending on the specific causes and treatments recommended for each individual case.
