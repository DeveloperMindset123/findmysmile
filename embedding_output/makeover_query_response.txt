Dental veneers can be utilized to address gaps between teeth as part of a smile makeover. Veneers are custom-designed thin shells that can cover the front surface of teeth, effectively closing spaces and improving the overall alignment of the smile. This cosmetic dentistry procedure can contribute to creating a more harmonious and balanced smile by addressing issues related to tooth spacing.
