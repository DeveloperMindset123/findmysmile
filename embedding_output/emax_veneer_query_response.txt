The emax veneer dental procedure involves reworking proximal areas using finishing and polishing strips, checking occlusion and function, polishing restoration margins with polishers or disks, applying a thin layer of Fluor Protector, removing excess material with a scaler, covering restoration margins with glycerine gel/air block to prevent oxygen inhibition, light-curing cementation joints, and rinsing off Liquid Strip if non-translucent, opaque restorative materials are used. Additionally, for partial crown preparation, it is important to ensure margins are not in the area of antagonist contacts, provide space in cusp areas, prepare a circular shoulder or chamfer with specific dimensions and angles, and maintain the width of the shoulder/chamfer.
