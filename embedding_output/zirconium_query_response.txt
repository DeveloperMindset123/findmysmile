Zirconia-based ceramics are a popular choice for various dental restorations like crowns, fixed partial dentures, and implants in esthetic areas. These restorations are known for their high core structure strength, achieved through CAD/CAM technology for fabrication. The process involves milling copings as fully sintered, hot isostatic press (HIP) blocks or in the pre-sintered state, with subsequent shrinkage of about 20% after sintering. The bonding and cementation of zirconia-based ceramic restorations are crucial steps in achieving durable tooth-ceramic interfaces for esthetic restorations.
