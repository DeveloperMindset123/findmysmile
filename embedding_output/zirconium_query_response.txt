Zirconia-based ceramics are a popular choice for various dental restorations like crowns, fixed partial dentures, and implants in esthetic areas. These restorations are known for their high core structure strength and are often fabricated using CAD/CAM technology. The process involves milling copings as fully sintered blocks or in the pre-sintered state, with subsequent shrinkage after sintering. The report emphasizes achieving esthetic restorations with a durable tooth-ceramic interface through proper cementation and bonding techniques specific to zirconia-based ceramic restorations.
