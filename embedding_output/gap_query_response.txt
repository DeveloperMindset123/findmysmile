The gap dental procedure involves the use of a dental bridge, which is a restorative dental prosthesis designed to replace missing teeth by bridging the gap between remaining teeth. This procedure typically includes the substitution of a missing tooth with a prosthetic tooth attached to adjacent natural teeth through bonding. There are two primary classifications of dental bridges: one involving two crowns affixed permanently to adjacent natural teeth with the artificial tooth in between, and the other being an adhesive bridge consisting of a pontic tooth flanked by wings bonded to adjacent teeth for support. The process may require preparatory measures on adjacent teeth, such as removing some enamel, to accommodate the bridge. Dental bridges are beneficial for improving chewing and speaking abilities, preventing teeth from shifting, and enhancing the appearance of the smile. However, there are considerations to keep in mind, such as the potential need for replacement over time and the unsuitability for certain individuals with specific dental conditions.
