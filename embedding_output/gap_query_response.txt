The gap dental procedure involves the placement of a dental bridge to replace missing teeth by bridging the gap between remaining teeth. This procedure typically includes the utilization of two crowns affixed permanently to adjacent natural teeth with an artificial tooth in between. There are two primary classifications of dental bridges: traditional bridges with crowns and adhesive bridges with wings bonded to adjacent teeth for support. The process may require enamel removal from adjacent teeth for preparation. Dental bridges can improve chewing and speaking abilities, prevent teeth shifting, and enhance the smile's appearance. However, they may not be suitable for all patients, especially those with significant dental issues like decay, gum disease, or bone loss. Regular maintenance and care are essential for the longevity and effectiveness of dental bridges.
